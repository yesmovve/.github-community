# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section

Interesting challenge for practicing CSS Grid.

Done it for 6h but design is slighty different from provided
jpg file because <div> element in grid have bigger
height for about 20px.

Design for 375px width screens is done.

Can be better but my knowledge is now on this level.

Will do it better next time.
